--SCRIPTS--
Player: .lua
Player inventory: .lua (require in Player.lua for inventory access)

Story (non-dynamic): .txt (long strings, pre-load depending on map selection)
Story (dynamic): .lua

Map: gui
Map data: .lua (logic tied to story)

--OPERATIONS--
story.lua and player_dialog.lua should "sync" with each other.
story.lua will have a question (key should include the string question to indicate a response is required).
player_dialog.lua should have an associated key with the player's responses.
A dialog manager file (.script) should manage all of the player responses and 'save' the responses in a .txt file (or other save file format).
* the matching key should be passed as a param as well as the associated answer ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc.)
* this will eliminate any need to manually save (although we may still want a manual save feature)
TODO: We need some way to track status of answers. How do we keep memory of player responses that might affect the story?
